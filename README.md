# Hangman offers a captivating solo word-guessing experience. Players select difficulty levels and themes, adding personalization. The game starts with a hidden word represented by dashes. Players guess letters to unveil the word, with correct guesses revealing positions. Each incorrect guess adds to a gallows or hangman's scaffold. Players set a limit for incorrect guesses based on difficulty. Success hinges on decoding the word within the limit. Hangman tests vocabulary and deductive skills, offering tailored challenges and themes for immersive gameplay.

# Tester's review
1 Add gui and make it an application in order to give a better interface to user and also add comments in the code for better understanding.
2 When numbers of guesses come to an end it  asks press yes to continue but if a user enters yeso/yeshi it understands it as yes rather than showing an error kindly check and correct this.
3 Add genre to it also.
All good no issues its all done
