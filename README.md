# Team Name - Task Titans
## Hangman offers a captivating solo word-guessing experience. Players select difficulty levels and themes, adding personalization. The game starts with a hidden word represented by dashes. Players guess letters to unveil the word, with correct guesses revealing positions. Each incorrect guess adds to a gallows or hangman's scaffold. Players set a limit for incorrect guesses based on difficulty. Success hinges on decoding the word within the limit. Hangman tests vocabulary and deductive skills, offering tailored challenges and themes for immersive gameplay.<br>

# Hangman Version 1.O
## Tester's review
When numbers of guesses come to an end it asks press yes to continue but if a user enters yeso/yeshi it understands it as yes rather than showing an error kindly check and correct this.<br>

## Developer's Action
Fixed this issue by specifing the correct string.

# Hangman Version 2.O
## Tester's Review
Add gui and make it an application in order to give a better interface to user and also add comments in the code for better understanding.<br>

## Developer's Action
I employed Tkinter in my Python Hangman game to design an intuitive and interactive user interface, allowing players to guess letters and track their progress seamlessly.
